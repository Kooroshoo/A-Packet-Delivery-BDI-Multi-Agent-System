# A Packet Delivery BDI Multi-Agent System
 A Packet Delivery BDI Multi-Agent System Created in Unity with the Unity Prolog framework. UnityProlog allows the design of BDI agents in Unity.
 
 The goal of this assignment consists of designing the management of an autonomous warehouse, where drones and robots are employed to retrieve, move and deliver packages (represented as boxes, in our case). The designed Multi-Agent System must be completely autonomous, hence there should not be any need for run-time human intervention. The implementation has to follow an agent-oriented approach.

This project is done in Unity 2017.4

**This framework was provided by Paolo Giorgini and Francesco Alzetta as part of the course Agent-oriented software engineering at the University of Trento.**

**The core implementation is courtesy of Nicola Poli and Universit√† degli Studi di Bologna.**
