# A Packet Delivery BDI Multi-Agent System
 A Packet Delivery BDI Multi-Agent System Created in Unity with the Unity Prolog framework. UnityProlog allows the design of BDI agents in Unity.
 
 The goal of this assignment consists of designing the management of an autonomous warehouse, where drones and robots are employed to retrieve, move and deliver packages (represented as boxes, in our case). The designed Multi-Agent System must be completely autonomous, hence there should not be any need for run-time human intervention. The implementation has to follow an agent-oriented approach.
